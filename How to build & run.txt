How the code was build?

1. I used React Native CLI rather than using Expo CLI because there are some limitations in Expo library. 
2. There are 2 screens for this application. The first screen is the Home screen where every story names will be displayed. The second screen will display
all of the categories, icons and story's name.
3. There are 7 components in this project. Two components are for the home screen and headers. I used 'props' to transmit the data from every components
to the header component.
